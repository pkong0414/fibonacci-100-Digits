/* The goal of this is to write a function that will implement each Fibonacci number with the help of an
 * int array of size 100 ( the elements will be used to store the digits in this array )
 * When the function is calld to find Fn, it will calculate all Fibonacci from F(2) to F(N) using fibonacci formula
 * write a program that will calculate Fibonacci numbers containing up to 100 digits
 *
 * Display the largest Fibonacci number that has less than 100 digits. Make sure that your program will display
 * an error message when the total has 100 digits or more.
